# Routing-Simulation

9 routers are instantiated. In the `ips.txt` file are the ips of the 9 routers, and in the` comunicação.txt` file are the data to be sent and the input and output routers of that data. Then communication is made between routers, and the data is sent.

Files are generated with the names of the routers that received data and this data is the content of the file.
